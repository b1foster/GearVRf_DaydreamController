# GearVR Framework Daydream controller

Demonstrates how to draw daydream controller with [Gear VR Framework](https://github.com/Samsung/GearVRf).
Arm model implementation was ported from [here](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/release/Engine/Plugins/Runtime/GoogleVR/GoogleVRController/Source/GoogleVRController/Private/ArmModel).

Daydream controller's model was created by [TechnoBuddhist](https://github.com/TechnoBuddhist/VR-Controller-Daydream). Thanks!
